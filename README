wolfSSL JNI Wrapper and JSSE Provider

This package provides both a Java, JNI-based interface to the native wolfSSL
(wolfSSL) API and a wolfSSL JSSE provider (wolfJSSE). These provide Java
applications with SSL/TLS support up to the current TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.2
standards.

Note 1)
The java.sh script uses a common location for the Java install location.
If your Java install location is different, this could lead to an error
when running java.sh. In this case, you should modify java.sh to match
your environment.

Build options are :
- ant build (only builds the jar necessary for an app to use)
- ant test  (builds the jar and tests then runs the tests, requires JUNIT setup)
- ant examples (builds the jar and example cases)
- ant clean   (cleans all)
